Hello, everyone. We are AI Squad, and We are excited to introduce you to our mobile application designed to empower voters for the upcoming presidential election in Sri Lanka. 
In an era where misinformation is widespread, we wanted to build a solution that promotes transparency and helps citizens make informed decisions.

 Our solution mobile application tackles this issue by providing voters with verified and accurate insights into the election landscape.

Let me walk you through the key features of our app:

1) Manifesto Comparator 

Our app includes a **Manifesto Comparator**, allowing users to compare the manifestos of different candidates side by side. Users can evaluate promises, goals, and key points directly, enabling them to make more informed choices about who aligns with their values and concerns.

2) AI-powered bot for Manifesto and Election Queries

We’ve integrated an **AI-powered chatbot** that responds to user questions instantly. Whether you want to know more about a candidate’s policies, compare their promises, or get details on election rules, this bot provides reliable and verified responses based on data collected from trustworthy sources.

3) Win Predictor

A standout feature of our app is the **Win Predictor**. This tool uses advanced data analytics to assess polling data, social media sentiment, and public opinion, giving users insights into potential election outcomes. It doesn’t just guess but leverages patterns and trends to predict the most likely results, helping voters understand where the election may be headed.

At the heart of our app is an **AI Agent Architecture**. Our architecture consists of different layers: 

- The **Data Collection Layer**, which gathers verified information from public sources like news outlets, social media, and candidate statements. 

- The **Processing Layer**, where we clean, filter, and verify the collected data. 

- The **Analysis Layer**, which powers the Win Predictor, analyzes data patterns, trends, and sentiment. 

- Finally, the **User Interaction Layer**, where the Manifesto Comparator and AI-powered chatbot interact with users to provide personalized insights.

Large language model and Google search tools help to provide detailed information about candidates' previous behaviors.
